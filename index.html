    <h3>The story</h3>
    <P>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <blockquote class="villagers">“We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away.</blockquote> This is most unfortunate.<blockquote class="farmer">The farmer said, “Maybe.”</blockquote> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said,<blockquote class="villagers">“Oh, isn’t that lucky</blockquote>. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!” The farmer again said,<blockquote class="farmer"> “Maybe.”</blockquote>

    The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <blockquote class="villagers">“Oh dear, that’s too bad,”</blockquote> and the farmer responded, <blockquote class="farmer">“Maybe.”</blockquote> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said,<blockquote class="villagers">“Isn’t that great!”</blockquote> Again, he said,<blockquote class="farmer">“Maybe.”</blockquote>

        The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is good or bad — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.

    <h5>Conclusion</h5>
    <p>Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
